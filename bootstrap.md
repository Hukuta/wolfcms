# Bootstrap change

This file should be a guide of sort for new theme/bootstrap.

## General idea

The idea is to merge currently separated admin files from /wolf/admin/stylesheets/admin.css and current selected theme /wolf/admin/themes/"theme name"/login.css and screen.css into just one file which would reside in latter folder. 

If you take a look at html5 branch, you can see how it is done there.

## Folders and files

I've created new folder under /wolf/admin/themes called "bootstrap" and within screen.css file.
Everything should be placed there and well commented.
